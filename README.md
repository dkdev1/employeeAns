Hi Dhruv,
Thank you for giving a chance to complete the test after running the time.
I have completed your test questions which were for transfer data from one table to another table ( For now I have completed the same database schema) . There was some issue with intelliJ only , as I have made another project and after I have tried It got resolved . In this I have applied logging by taking reference from my sample project so that we can easily check flow of code.
I will try another question which you asked and will let you know the code asap.
Thank you
